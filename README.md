Ecole_Microservices
Ecole Microservices is a project that implements a microservices architecture for managing students, teachers, and subjects in a school environment. 
Each microservice (Student, Teacher, Subject) provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using REST API, GraphQL, Kafka, and gRPC for efficient communication and data exchange between services.

Overview :
The project aims to demonstrate the utilization of microservices architecture and various communication protocols (REST API, GraphQL, Kafka, gRPC) to efficiently manage school-related data. 
With distinct microservices handling specific domains (students, teachers, subjects), the system promotes modularity, scalability, and maintainability.

Features : 
Microservices Architecture: Three microservices (Student, Teacher, Subject) are implemented to handle CRUD operations independently.
REST API: Each microservice exposes RESTful endpoints for performing CRUD operations on student, teacher, and subject entities.
GraphQL: GraphQL endpoints are provided to offer flexible and precise data querying capabilities.
Kafka Integration: Kafka is employed for asynchronous communication between microservices, enabling event-driven architecture.
gRPC Services: gRPC is utilized for high-performance, inter-service communication, enhancing efficiency and scalability.
